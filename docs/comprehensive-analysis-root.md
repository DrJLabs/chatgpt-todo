# Comprehensive Analysis â€” chatgpt-todo-app

## Configuration Highlights
- `client/vite.config.js` sets Vite base URL to `https://lignitic-sustentative-kasi.ngrok-free.dev` and enables React + Tailwind plugins.
- `client/tailwind.config.js` scans `index.html` and `src/**/*` for utility classes; no custom theme extensions.
- `client/eslint.config.js` applies ESLint recommended rules with React Hooks/Refresh plugins; ignores `dist` outputs.

## Entry Points
- `client/src/main.jsx` boots the SPA, importing Tailwind CSS globals and rendering `<App />` inside `<StrictMode>`.
- `client/src/App.jsx` orchestrates UI, handles REST calls, and integrates with MCP globals.
- `server/index.js` sets up Express, registers REST endpoints, and exposes MCP tools + widget resource; listens on port 3000.

## Shared Utilities
- `client/src/useOpenAiGlobal.js` is the sole shared hook, abstracting MCP global subscriptions.

## Auth & Security Observations
- No auth middleware yet; CORS allows all origins and requests.
- Better Auth integration plan should introduce session middleware and authenticated fetches.

## CI/CD & Localization
- No CI workflow files or localization assets detected.

## Summary
- Configuration is minimal and dev-focused, with hard-coded localhost URLs and ngrok base.
- Production hardening requires: environment variables, authentication, persistence, and CI automation.
