# Comprehensive Analysis â€” chatgpt-todo-app

## Configuration Highlights
- `client/vite.config.js` reads the Vite base URL from `VITE_CLIENT_BASE` (default `'/'`) and enables React + Tailwind plugins.
- `client/tailwind.config.js` scans `index.html` and `src/**/*` for utility classes; no custom theme extensions.
- `client/eslint.config.js` applies ESLint recommended rules with React Hooks/Refresh plugins; ignores `dist` outputs.

## Entry Points
- `client/src/main.jsx` boots the SPA, importing Tailwind CSS globals and rendering `<App />` inside `<StrictMode>`.
- `client/src/App.jsx` orchestrates UI, handles REST calls, and integrates with MCP globals.
- `server/index.js` sets up Express, registers REST endpoints, and exposes MCP tools + widget resource; listens on port 3000.

## Shared Utilities
- `client/src/useOpenAiGlobal.js` is the sole shared hook, abstracting MCP global subscriptions.

## Auth & Security Observations
- Session-based authentication is enforced via `requireSession` (Better Auth) whenever `ENABLE_AUTH_GATE` remains `true`; toggling the flag is a documented rollback lever.
- CORS is restricted to origins listed in `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and always returns `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` so cookies survive cross-origin calls.
- Ensure rollback guidance highlights the security risk of disabling the gate for extended periods.

## CI/CD & Localization
- No CI workflow files or localization assets detected.

## Summary
- Configuration is dev-focused but now driven by env vars (`VITE_*`, `ENABLE_AUTH_GATE`, `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`); defaults target localhost Better Auth services.
- Production hardening still requires persistence, comprehensive monitoring, and CI automation, plus careful management of the auth gate rollback flags.
